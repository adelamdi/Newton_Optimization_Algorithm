Introduction to **Newton's Optimization Algorithm** with a practical Example

This repository provides an introduction to Newton's Optimization Algorithm and a practical example of its implementation.
We begin by considering the following function:
$y = 3 sin(2t + Ï€/6)$
However, in a more general scenario, we may not have access to the specific constants defining the function. Instead, we might encounter a function of the form:
$y = A sin(Wt + Z)$
where A, W, and Z are unknown parameters. Our objective is to determine the values of A, W, and Z that would yield a solution similar to the first function using Newton's method for optimization.

What you'll learn:
* The basics of Newton's Optimization Algorithm
* Implementing Newton's method in Python

*We will delve into a more detailed basic concepts, explanation of steps, Newton's optimization algorithm python code and a practical example in [this jupyter notebook](NewtonOptimization.ipynb).*
